# The-impact-of-coronavirus-related-lockdowns-on-air-quality-in-England-and-Scotland
***
In December 2019, the first cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic occurred, since then there have been several studies addressing the environmental impact of lockdowns worldwide.
 Some studies have indicated that air quality has improved because of the restrictions placed on travel.
 It was found that COVID-19 caused Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) to decrease by about 7 μg/m3 and 5-points in China, respectively.
 Similarly, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a 91.12% lower concentration of Particulate Matter 10 (PM10) in the air across nine cities was noted.
 These studies concluded that their results were due to the reduction of industrial and travel pollution because of the lockdown.
 In the United Kingdom, a national lockdown was enforced on March 26, 2020, as such this study has anticipated a similar trend in air quality from this point.
 It was decided that this would be assessed by comparing air quality data-in particular, PM2.5 and PM10 for 2019 and 2020 across England and Scotland, the results found that air quality levels for these variables did show considerable improvements for individual sites because of lockdowns.
 Based on our analyses, missing data led to an overall statistically insignificant result.

As an assessment the group produced code files, a write up and a presentation, and recieved a grade A1, scoring 100%.

After a call for papers email and upon obtaining permission from the rest of the group, I then eddited and submitted the paper to the [Granite Journal](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/pgrs/training-development/granitejournal.php#panel710) where it was peer reviewed and [published](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/pgrs/documents/Granite%20Air%20Quality%20.pdf) on the 29th July 2022 in Volume 7 - "Well-being and Health of People and Places".

I have also shared both the project version and the published version on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366154936_The_impact_of_coronavirus-related_lockdowns_on_air_quality_in_England_and_Scotland).
